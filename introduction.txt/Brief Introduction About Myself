My name is Amani Katua. I am 20 years old, from Kenya; a firstborn in a single-parent family of four. I am passionate about everything business, and am currently curious about how businesses sustainably buld and scale to global horizons. I've joined Strathmore Unoversity - Business School to learn more about this.
I began my first business when I was seven years old - selling banana bread, jewelry, and teaching baking classes. Since then, I have expanded to e-commerce with print on demand, and personal shopper experiences. My current short term (3 years) goal is to be financially free by the time I am 23 years old (2028).
